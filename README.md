#Subword Image Alignment
I wrote this during the summer of 2016 at BYU.

This is a project to come up with an effective method to align to word images on matching n-grams using dynamic time warping. This can help generate more accurate training data.

This is still in the birthing stages of development.

This relies on Doug Kennard's image processing code. 

Some of my segmenting and stitching code is included here as well.
